Topmodel estimates \r\nriver discharge and spatial soil water saturation patterns for a particular catchment basin using topographic, climatic, and \r\ngeological input data parameters. The original WATER application was developed by the [U.S. Geological Survey Indiana and \r\nKentucky Water Science Centers (INKY)].

This directory should contain all the same type of WATER simulations *single* or *batch*, but not both.\r\nA user should make sure that the proper settings for processing a *single* or *batch* simulation are set in the *user_settings.py* file.\r\nNote that the *simulation_directory* variable will be ignored when using this script, but all the other settings will be used accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Usage:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ run_simulations.sh [option] <path-to-simulations-directory>\r\n$ run_simulations.sh [[[-applywateruse] [-applysubwateruse] [-applygcmdelta] [-applysubgcmdelta]] <path-to-simulations-directory> | [-h]]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Command line arguments for the shell script [run_simulations.sh](run_simulations.sh):\r\n\r\n| Commands              | Description |                                                                              \r\n| --------              | ----------- |                                                                               \r\n|`-h`                   | show list of available commands |\r\n|`-applywateruse`       | run and apply [water use data](data/wateruse-datafiles) to sample WATER simulations; [single and batch simulations](data/sample-water-simulations) |\r\n|`-applysubwateruse`    | run and apply substitute water use data to sample WATER simulations; [single and batch simulations](data/sample-water-simulations) |\r\n|`-applygcmdelta`       | run and apply [global climate model data](data/gcmdelta-datafiles) to sample WATER simulations; [single and batch simulations](data/sample-water-simulations) |\r\n|`-applysubgcmdelta`    | run and apply substitute water use data to sample WATER simulations; [single and batch simulations](data/sample-water-simulations) |\r\n\r\n### Example - apply water use to many WATER simulations :\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ run_simulations.sh -applywateruse <path-to-simulations-directory>\r\n```\r\n\r\n*** \r\n\r\n## Graphical user interface\r\n\r\nThe multi-threaded graphical user interface (GUI) called [waterapputils_gui](waterapputils/waterapputils_gui.py) can be started\r\nusing the command below or by simply double clicking on the `waterapputils_gui.py` file.  \r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ python waterapputils_gui.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe GUI consists of 4 tabs:\r\n\r\n1. Process WATER output text file\r\n2. Compare 2 WATER output text files\r\n3. Apply water use to WATER simulations\r\n4. Apply global climate model (GCM) deltas to WATER simulations \r\n\r\n### Process WATER output text file \r\n\r\nA user opens a WATER simulation output text file (WATER.txt), and all the paramters and corresponding data are processed.  The first parameter in the data file is \r\nplotted initially and the user can use the list on the bottom left of the tab to select different parameters to plot.  The plot includes a text area showing some simple \r\nstatistics for the parameter.  All the parameters and corresponding data are also placed in a read-only table. A user can interact with the plot using the buttons on the top \r\nof the plotting area (zoom, pan, etc.).  In addition, a user can enable a **span selector** which allows a user to query the data for specific time periods.  Upon using the \r\n**span selector**, the simple stats displayed in the text area with the simple statistics updates for the selected time period.\r\n\r\n### Compare 2 WATER output text files \r\n\r\nA user opens 2 WATER simulation output text files, and the **Compare** button will be enabled.  Upon clicking the **Compare** button, all the parameters and corresponding data \r\nare processed and compared.  The first parameters in the data file are overlayed together with the first file colored as blue and the second file colored as red.  A second \r\nplot is made which shows the difference between the respective parameters in each file. The user can use the list on the bottom left of the tab to select different parameters \r\nto compare.  All the parameters and corresponding data for both files are placed in read-only tables.  A user can interact with the plots using the buttons on the top of the \r\nplotting area (zoom, pan, etc.).  Note that the difference plot is tied to the overlay plot, meaning that when a user pans or zooms on the overlay plot, the difference \r\nplot will zoom or pan with the overlay plot.  \r\n\r\n### Apply water use to WATER simulations\r\n\r\nAllows a user to apply water use data to WATER simulation output text files (WATER.txt).  \r\n\r\n#### Number of simulation(s) - a user selects the number of WATER simulations.\r\n\r\n- *One simulation* (default) - one batch or single type WATER simulation.\r\n- *Multiple simulations* - more than one batch or single type WATER simulations. \r\n\r\n> **NOTE: The directory containing all the WATER simulations to process must *only* contain WATER simulations.  Do not include extraneous files or directories in the parent \r\n> directory containing all the WATER simulations to process.**\r\n\r\n#### Type of simulation(s) - a user selects the type of WATER simulation.\r\n\r\n- *Batch* - more than one basin.  For an example, please see the [Sample Batch Simulation](data/sample-batch-simulations-sample-batch-simulation).\r\n- *Single* - one basin.  For an example, please see the [Sample Single Simulation](data/sample-batch-simulations-sample-single-simulation).\r\n\r\nThe following are the directory structures created by WATER for batch and single simulations:\r\n\r\n**Batch Simulation:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nsimulation/\r\n            basin1/\r\n                    amask/\r\n                    basinmask/\r\n                    fmask/\r\n                    info/\r\n                    rmask/\r\n                    Temp/\r\n                    .\r\n                    .\r\n                    WATER.txt\r\n                    WATERSimulation.xml\r\n            basin2/\r\n            basin3/\r\n            .\r\n            .\r\n            Water.txt\r\n            Watersheds.shp\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Single Simulation:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nsimulation/\r\n            amask/\r\n            basinmask/\r\n            fmask/\r\n            info/\r\n            rmask/\r\n            Temp/\r\n            .\r\n            .\r\n            basinMask.shp\r\n            WATER.txt\r\n            WATERSimulation.xml\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Simulation Information - a user selects the WATER simulation of interest to apply water use too.  \r\n\r\nIf a valid WATER simulation is selected, the rest of the inputs in the *Simulation Information* section will auto-populate.  A user can select \r\nthe proper *Basin shapefile id field* that was used when running the WATER application.  The *Basin shapefile id field* is was used by the WATER \r\napplication to name the output basin directories in the simulation directory structure. The *Basin shapefile area field* is used to get the areas\r\nof each respective basin for use in an external ecoflow program.\r\n\r\n> **NOTE: A batch WATER simulation will contain a shapefile of the basins called *Watersheds.shp*.  A single WATER simulation will contain a \r\n> shapefile of the basin called *basinMask.shp*.  A WATER simulation must have an associated *Watersheds.shp* or *basinMask.shp* file.** \r\n\r\n#### Water Use Information - a user selects the seasonal water use data files and associated information.  \r\n\r\nA user selects 4 seasonal water use files:\r\n\r\n1. January, Feburary, March\r\n2. April, May, June\r\n3. July, August, September\r\n4. October, November, December\r\n\r\nA user selects a water use factor file which can be used to adjust the water use data values in the seasonal water use files.\r\n\r\nA user selects the water use shapefile which is a shapefile of water use points across the entire modeling domain.  \r\n\r\n> **NOTE: All WATER application shapefiles are in the Albers NAD83 projection. Please ensure that the water use shapefile is in the same projection as all the other WATER \r\n> application shapefiles.** \r\n\r\nA user chooses the id field from the water use shapefile that corresponds to the id field used in the water use data files.  \r\n\r\n> **NOTE: The sample \r\n> water use files and water use shapefile have *newhydroid* as the id field.**\r\n\r\nIf the basins in the WATER use simulation do not overlap/intersect with the water use shapefile points, then the user can choose to apply \r\nsubstitute water use.  \r\n\r\n> **NOTE: In order to apply substitute water use, the user must first apply water use without this option.  The \r\n> waterapputils program will warn and log any basins in the WATER simulation that do not overlap/intersect with the water use shapefile points.  \r\n> The waterapputils program will create a file called *wateruse_non_intersecting_centroids.txt* in a directory called *waterapputils-info* with a \r\n> list of the basins that do not overlap/intersect.  A user must manually enter the proper water use shapefile id (i.e. newhydroid) values to be \r\n> used when applying the substitute water use. In order to apply substitute water use, the file called *wateruse_non_intersecting_centroids.txt* in \r\n> a directory called *waterapputils-info* must exist.**\r\n\r\nA user clicks the *Check Inputs* button which checks and makes sure that all the fields have been entered.  Upon all the fields being entered and \r\nthe *ChecK Inputs* button being pressed, the *Apply Water Use*, *Plot Overview Map*, and *Plot Zoomed Map* buttons are enabled.  If a user clicks\r\nthe *Apply Water Use*, then waterapputils applies water use to the WATER simulation given the data provided by the user.  The **waterapputils_gui**\r\nwill apply water use in a *separate thread* meaning that the process will be run in the background allowing the user to continue using other parts of \r\nthe **waterapputils_gui** without interferring with the water use processing. \r\n\r\n> **NOTE: When processing water use, a warning about a *QPixmap* may appear. This is not an error, but only a warning that can safely be ignored here.  The warning stems from \r\n> the use of using the same plotting code used in the command line version of waterapputils when applying water use.** If a user clicks the *Plot Overview Map*, a map of the \r\n> WATER basin shapefile (Watersheds.shp or basinMask.shp) will be plotted in a zoomed out view or the entire modeling domain.  If a user clicks the *Plot Zoomed Map*, a map of \r\n> the WATER basin shapefile (Watersheds.shp or basinMask.shp) will be plotted in a zoomed in view with additional shapefiles (i.e. usgs gages).  \r\n\r\n### Apply global climate model (GCM) deltas to WATER simulations\r\n\r\nAllows a user to apply global climate model (GCM) deltas to WATER simulation database files (WATERSimulation.xml).  \r\n\r\n#### Number of simulation(s) - a user selects the number of WATER simulations.\r\n\r\n- *One simulation* (default) - one batch or single type WATER simulation.\r\n- *Multiple simulations* - more than one batch or single type WATER simulations. \r\n\r\n> **NOTE: The directory containing all the WATER simulations to process must *only* contain WATER simulations.  Do not include extraneous files or directories in the parent \r\n> directory containing all the WATER simulations to process.**\r\n\r\n#### Type of simulation(s) - a user selects the type of WATER simulation.\r\n\r\n- *Batch* - more than one basin.  For an example, please see the [Sample Batch Simulation](data/sample-batch-simulations-sample-batch-simulation).\r\n- *Single* - one basin.  For an example, please see the [Sample Single Simulation](data/sample-batch-simulations-sample-single-simulation).\r\n\r\nThe following are the directory structures created by WATER for batch and single simulations:\r\n\r\n**Batch Simulation:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nsimulation/\r\n            basin1/\r\n                    amask/\r\n                    basinmask/\r\n                    fmask/\r\n                    info/\r\n                    rmask/\r\n                    Temp/\r\n                    .\r\n                    .\r\n                    WATER.txt\r\n                    WATERSimulation.xml\r\n            basin2/\r\n            basin3/\r\n            .\r\n            .\r\n            Water.txt\r\n            Watersheds.shp\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Single Simulation:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nsimulation/\r\n            amask/\r\n            basinmask/\r\n            fmask/\r\n            info/\r\n            rmask/\r\n            Temp/\r\n            .\r\n            .\r\n            basinMask.shp\r\n            WATER.txt\r\n            WATERSimulation.xml\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Simulation Information - a user selects the WATER simulation of interest to apply global climate model deltas too.  \r\n\r\nIf a valid WATER simulation is selected, the rest of the inputs in the *Simulation Information* section will auto-populate.  A user can select \r\nthe proper *Basin shapefile id field* that was used when running the WATER application.  The *Basin shapefile id field* is was used by the WATER \r\napplication to name the output basin directories in the simulation directory structure. The *Basin shapefile area field* is used to get the areas\r\nof each respective basin for use in an external ecoflow program.\r\n\r\n> **NOTE: A batch WATER simulation will contain a shapefile of the basins called *Watersheds.shp*.  A single WATER simulation will contain a \r\n> shapefile of the basin called *basinMask.shp*.  A WATER simulation must have an associated *Watersheds.shp* or *basinMask.shp* file.** \r\n\r\n#### Global Climate Model Delta Information - a user selects 3 global climate model delta files and associated information.  \r\n\r\nA user selects 3 global climate model delta files:\r\n\r\n1. PET.txt\r\n2. Ppt.txt\r\n3. Tmax.txt\r\n\r\nA user selects the global climate model shapefile which is a shapefile of rectangular tiles for a particular global climate model that covers the entire modeling domain.  \r\n\r\n> **NOTE: All WATER application shapefiles are in the Albers NAD83 projection. Please ensure that the global climate model shapefile shapefile is in the same projection as all the other WATER \r\n> application shapefiles.** \r\n\r\nA user chooses the id field from the global climate model shapefile that corresponds to the id field used in the 3 global climate model delta files.  \r\n\r\n> **NOTE: The sample \r\n> global climate model delta files and global climate model shapefile have *Tile* as the id field.**\r\n\r\nIf the basins in the WATER use simulation do not overlap/intersect with the global climate model shapefile tiles, then the user can choose to apply \r\nsubstitute global climate model deltas.  \r\n\r\n> **NOTE: In order to apply substitute global climate model deltas, the user must first apply global climate model deltas without this option.  The \r\n> waterapputils program will warn and log any basins in the WATER simulation that do not overlap/intersect with the global climate model deltas shapefile tiles.  \r\n> The waterapputils program will create a file called *gcm_delta_non_intersecting_tiles.txt* in a directory called *waterapputils-info* with a \r\n> list of the basins that do not overlap/intersect.  A user must manually enter the proper global climate model deltas shapefile id (i.e. Tile) values to be \r\n> used when applying the substitute global climate model deltas. In order to apply substitute global climate model deltas, the file called *gcm_delta_non_intersecting_tiles.txt* in \r\n> a directory called *waterapputils-info* must exist.**\r\n\r\nA user clicks the *Check Inputs* button which checks and makes sure that all the fields have been entered.  Upon all the fields being entered and \r\nthe *ChecK Inputs* button being pressed, the *Apply Water Use*, *Plot Overview Map*, and *Plot Zoomed Map* buttons are enabled.  If a user clicks\r\nthe *Apply Global Climate Model Deltas*, then waterapputils applies global climate model deltas to the WATER simulation given the data provided by the user.  The **waterapputils_gui**\r\nwill apply global climate model deltas in a *separate thread* meaning that the process will be run in the background allowing the user to continue using other parts of \r\nthe **waterapputils_gui** without interferring with the global climate model deltas processing. \r\n\r\n> **NOTE: When processing global climate model deltas, a warning about a *QPixmap* may appear. This is not an error, but only a warning that can safely be ignored here.  The warning stems from \r\n> the use of using the same plotting code used in the command line version of waterapputils when applying global climate model deltas.** If a user clicks the *Plot Overview Map*, a map of the \r\n> WATER basin shapefile (Watersheds.shp or basinMask.shp) will be plotted in a zoomed out view or the entire modeling domain.  If a user clicks the *Plot Zoomed Map*, a map of \r\n> the WATER basin shapefile (Watersheds.shp or basinMask.shp) will be plotted in a zoomed in view with additional shapefiles (i.e. usgs gages).  \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nAutomated tests for **waterapputils** were written using the [nose] library, and are contained in the *tests* directory. [nose] must be\r\ninstalled in order to run tests. Automated tests can be run using the `nosetests` command at the project level directory (not \r\nwithin the *tests* directory, but the *waterapputils* directory containing the *tests* directory).  A successful test run \r\nwill look something like the following:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ pwd\r\n/path/to/waterapputils    \r\n\r\n$ nosetests\r\nSETUP: deltatxt tests\r\n........TEARDOWN: deltatxt tests\r\n...\r\nSETUP: waterxml tests\r\n........TEARDOWN: waterxml tests\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nRan 91 tests in 1.049s\r\n\r\nOK\r\n```\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Repository layout\r\n\r\n\tbin/\t\t\t\t\t\t            # executables/scripts\r\n\tdata/\t\t\t\t\t\t            # sample data files to use with software and associated information\r\n\t\tdeltas-gcm/                         # statistically downscaled global climate model data\r\n        sample-water-simulations            # sample WATER application simulations and datasets\r\n            sample-batch-simulation         # sample WATER application batch run simulation\r\n            sample-datasets                 # sample WATER application simulation datasets\r\n            sample-single-simulation        # sample WATER applicaiton single run simulation\r\n        spatial-datafiles/                  # spatial data;
