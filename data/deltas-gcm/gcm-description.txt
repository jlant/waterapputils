Historic precipitation and temperature simulations will be compared to those for future conditions extending to 2100 for multiple Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) global circulation models (GCMs) and representative concentration pathways (RCPs) tied to low, mitigative (RCP4.5) and high, 
continued radiative forcing (RCP8.5) conditions (Taylor and others, 2011).  A change factor approach will be used to assess the increase in frequency of the 
historically indicated over-flow periods that could be expected given the range in projected climate conditions.
